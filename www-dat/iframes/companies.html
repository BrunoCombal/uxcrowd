		Companies can decide to test their interfaces in the wild, opening to anyone, at no cost.<br/><br/>
		A paid account allows privacy: just invite users with a private link. No need for them to register for testing the interface, they remain anonymous. Get the stats, analyse, improve, retry<br/>
		UXCrowd is cloud based: we can fit any size of test.
